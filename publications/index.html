This paper introduces a novel strength system, including a strength estimator (SE) and an SE-based Monte Carlo tree search, denoted as SE-MCTS, which predicts strengths from games and offers different playing strengths with human styles. The strength estimator calculates strength scores and predicts ranks from games without direct human interaction. SE-MCTS utilizes the strength scores in a Monte Carlo tree search to adjust playing strength and style. We first conduct experiments in Go, a challenging board game with a wide range of ranks. Our strength estimator significantly achieves over 80% accuracy in predicting ranks by observing 15 games only, whereas the previous method reached 49% accuracy for 100 games. For strength adjustment, SE-MCTS successfully adjusts to designated ranks while achieving a 51.33% accuracy in aligning to human actions, outperforming a previous state-of-the-art, with only 42.56% accuracy. To demonstrate the generality of our strength system, we further apply SE and SE-MCTS to chess and obtain consistent results. These results show a promising approach to strength estimation and adjustment, enhancing human-AI interactions in games.

This phenomenon has been observed repeatedly in over-the-board games between high-level players and professionals. However, less is known about the prevalence of white’s advantage in games played between amateurs in more casual settings. This article attempts to identify a first-move advantage in chess by examining a large database of amateur games played online on a dedicated chess website. Win rates are calculated for various rating levels, and the influence of opening move choice is also explored. These results can help determine whether there is an inherent first-move advantage in chess observable for all players in multiple settings, or if this effect is exclusively seen with players of high skill during games played in person.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="cruz:2025:understanding-learned-look-ahead-behavior-chess-neural-networks" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Understanding the learned look-ahead behavior of chess neural networks</div> <div class="author"> Diogo Cruz </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>CoRR</em>, 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> keywords from rejected openreview submission: https://openreview.net/forum?id=OcBAd0JPxv&amp;noteId=ZcMfmDpMpn </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2505.21552" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We investigate the look-ahead capabilities of chess-playing neural networks, specifically focusing on the Leela Chess Zero policy network. We build on the work of Jenner et al. (2024) by analyzing the model’s ability to consider future moves and alternative sequences beyond the immediate next move. Our findings reveal that the network’s look-ahead behavior is highly context-dependent, varying significantly based on the specific chess position. We demonstrate that the model can process information about board states up to seven moves ahead, utilizing similar internal mechanisms across different future time steps. Additionally, we provide evidence that the network considers multiple possible move sequences rather than focusing on a single line of play. These results offer new insights into the emergence of sophisticated look-ahead capabilities in neural networks trained on strategic tasks, contributing to our understanding of AI reasoning in complex domains.

Addressing the broader goal of enhancing AI trustworthiness through transparency, accountability, and controllability, we focus on techniques to understand, quantify, and manipulate these latent space representations. Through a series of analyses, we examine several chess-playing GPT models as controlled testbeds, leveraging their structured decision space to explore emergent representations and decision-making processes. Key contributions include a mechanistic analysis of the attention heads and latent representations, the development of novel metrics for evaluating intervention outcomes, and the application of linear probe classifiers to decode and edit the model’s internal world representations. Analysis of the probe weight vectors reveals that the chess-playing GPT developed an emergent world model of the game that includes pieces, positions, and movement rules, and provides empirical support for the linear representation hypothesis–the idea that abstract concepts are encoded as specific directions in the model’s hidden state space. Complementary analysis of the hidden state vectors demonstrates that the model’s internal representations honor the Markovian property of chess. Experimental results demonstrate that linear interventions can causally steer GPT outputs while preserving their semantic validity. Drawing on the dose-response analogy from medicine, we vary both the strength and position of interventions, showing that output quality is maximized when intervention strength follows an exponentially decaying schedule across token positions. Similar experiments using sparse autoencoders in place of linear probes yielded significantly poorer performance. These results highlight the effectiveness of simple linear probes as valuable tools for interpretability and control. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="diallo:2025:chessmovellm-large-language-models-chess-next-move-prediction" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">ChessMoveLLM: Large Language Models for Chess Next Move Prediction</div> <div class="author"> Kassim B.

In this study, 28 high school students who were active in chess and participated in provincial and national chess leagues were selected. Based on the NEO Five-Factor Inventory of personality traits, they were divided into two groups: 14 extroverted students (17 \pm 0.88) and 14 introverted students (16.5 \pm 1.02). Each participant attended three separate sessions in the laboratory, with a minimum 72-hour rest period between sessions. In each session, participants performed the Iowa Gambling Task and the Lichess computer game before any stimulation. They were then subjected to one of three conditions: right anodal/left cathodal, right cathodal/left anodal, or sham stimulation, for 20 minutes at 2 mA intensity over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. After the stimulation, participants repeated the Iowa Gambling Task and the Lichess computer game. Data analysis using two-way mixed ANOVA revealed a significant difference in the Iowa Gambling Task between right anodal/left cathodal and right cathodal/left anodal stimulation based on personality traits (p = 0.001). The findings of this study indicated that transcranial direct current stimulation had a differential effect on decision-making in chess players based on their personality traits. Specifically, the study’s results showed that extroverted players exhibited more risk-taking behaviour, while introverted players acted more cautiously.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="giadikiaroglou:2025:investgiating-capabilities-language-models-puzzles" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Investigating the capabilities of language models in puzzle reasoning: A survey and experimental analysis</div> <div class="author"> Panagiotis Giadikiaroglou </div> <div class="periodical"> Mar 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.26240/heal.ntua.29165" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Puzzle-solving has long served as a benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence, testing a model’s ability to reason, infer, and strategize across complex problem spaces. Traditional AI and machine learning methods, such as symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning, have made notable strides in structured domains like board games and logic puzzles. However, as neural networks and, more recently, large language models (LLMs) have evolved, new possibilities have emerged for tackling a broader range of puzzle types, including those requiring nuanced commonsense reasoning, abstract pattern recognition, and complex multi-step calculations. LLMs, with their vast data-driven language capabilities, hold unique potential to bridge structured logical tasks and less formal, knowledge-based puzzles. Despite these advances, the current landscape of puzzle-solving with LLMs reveals both achievements and limitations, particularly when models are tasked with problems that demand interpretative reasoning and precise calculation. This thesis explores the evolving role of LLMs in solving such complex reasoning tasks, specifically focusing on their puzzle-solving capabilities. Divided into two main sections, the thesis first provides a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in LLM methodologies, covering diverse prompting techniques, neuro-symbolic approaches, and fine-tuning strategies for puzzles. Using a newly proposed taxonomy, puzzles are categorized into rule-based and rule-less types, with each category examined for its unique cognitive demands on LLMs. The second section presents experimental evaluations conducted on four datasets–two math-based datasets (GSM8K, SVAMP) and two puzzle-focused datasets (Game of 24 and RiddleSense). Various reasoning techniques, including Input-Output (IO) prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (LtM), and Faithful-CoT methods, are employed to assess LLM performance. Models of varying scales, particularly smaller LLMs like Llama-3.1 family and Mistral, are tested across settings such as zero-shot, few-shot, and self-consistency to evaluate their efficacy in solving complex and multi-step reasoning tasks. The thesis provides critical insights into the performance limitations of current LLMs in puzzle-solving, particularly noting that advanced reasoning methods like Faithful-CoT and puzzle translation techniques yield inconsistent improvements with smaller models. Finally, it outlines future research directions, advocating for expanded dataset creation, neuro-symbolic integration, and advancements in puzzle generation. This thesis aims to deepen our understanding of LLMs’ reasoning abilities and highlight pathways to enhance their performance in complex cognitive tasks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hull:2025:beyond-evaluation-learning-contextual-chess-position-representations" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Beyond Evaluation: Learning Contextual Chess Position Representations</div> <div class="author"> Ben Hull </div> <div class="periodical"> Mar 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> Technical report </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hwang:2025:can-large-language-models-develop-strategic-reasoning-post-training-insights-learning-chess" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Can Large Language Models Develop Strategic Reasoning?

Both platforms feature extensive app stores with millions of applications available for download. While security measures are in place to prevent the distribution of malicious or vulnerable apps, instances of malware have still been discovered in both stores. These incidents highlight a significant security risk that threatens user privacy and highlights the urgent need for advanced research in detecting malicious code and security vulnerabilities in mobile applications. As a step toward addressing this challenge, this thesis explores the feasibility of using binary similarity detection techniques to identify similarities between Android and iOS applications. To achieve this, we designed and implemented a novel analysis pipeline specifically tailored for comparing Android apps (compiled into binary OAT files) with iOS binaries. This pipeline enables the automatic identification of matches between corresponding applications across both platforms. The pipeline comprises several key stages, including preparing the apps and their third-party libraries for binary analysis, disassembling the binaries using both IDA Pro and Ghidra to account for potential variations introduced by different disassemblers, and conducting similarity analysis on the disassembly results. To assess the effectiveness of our pipeline, we conducted a comprehensive analysis on a dataset of 100 cross-platform apps. Our findings indicate that current binary similarity analysis methods have limitations in directly identifying cross-platform similarities between applications. However, we demonstrated that incorporating third-party libraries into the analysis significantly enhances similarity detection and can help to provide meaningful insights. This highlights the crucial role that third-party libraries play in cross-platform app analysis. Additionally, we found that the choice of disassembler has a significant impact on analysis results. Notably, no single disassembler proved to be clearly superior, as both exhibited their own strengths and limitations.

Wasm is a portable, compact binary code format with high performance and robust sandboxing properties. As Wasm applications grow in size and importance, the complex performance characteristics of diverse Wasm engines demand robust, representative benchmarks for proper tuning. Stopgap benchmark suites, such as PolyBenchC and libsodium, continue to be used in the literature, though they are known to be unrepresentative. Porting of more complex suites remains difficult because Wasm lacks many system APIs and extracting real-world Wasm benchmarks from the web is difficult due to complex host interactions. To address this challenge, we introduce Wasm-R3, the first record and replay technique for Wasm. Wasm-R3 transparently injects instrumentation into Wasm modules to record an execution trace from inside the module, then reduces the execution trace via several optimizations, and finally produces a replay module that is executable standalone without any host environment-on any engine. The benchmarks created by our approach are (i) realistic, because the approach records real-world web applications, (ii) faithful to the original execution, because the replay benchmark includes the unmodified original code, only adding emulation of host interactions, and (iii) standalone, because the replay benchmarks run on any engine. Applying Wasm-R3 to web-based Wasm applications in the wild demonstrates the correctness of our approach as well as the effectiveness of our optimizations, which reduce the recorded traces by 99.53% and the size of the replay benchmark by 9.98%. We release the resulting benchmark suite of 27 applications, called Wasm-R3-Bench, to the community, to inspire a new generation of realistic and standalone Wasm benchmarks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="banerjee:2024:skill-v-chance-card-board-games" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Skill vs. Chance Quantification for Popular Card &amp; Board Games</div> <div class="author"> Tathagata Banerjee, Anushka De, Subhamoy Maitra, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

In this paper, we looked at predicting a level’s difficulty and enjoyment. Past work has approached this problem for puzzle games like Sudoku by analyzing the characteristics of the initial level, the solved level, and the process that led to that solution. In this work, we examined a set of heuristics for Roguelike levels and their solutions, and their relationship to subjective player ratings of the levels. We gathered ratings of difficulty and enjoyment of levels in a study with 143 players. We ran an ablation study on the set of heuristics to find the best combination of heuristics for predicting difficulty and enjoyment with a linear regression model, and found solution path-based heursitics performed well. However, these models did not outperform a simple baseline for predicting enjoyment. Jaccard similarity on paths–a method we have not seen used in the field of game AI–was a useful predictor of difficulty. Testing proximity to enemies across a solution path is the only heuristic needed to predict how enjoyable a level will be.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="bjorkqvist:2024:estimating-puzzlingness-chess-puzzles" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Estimating the Puzzlingness of Chess Puzzles</div> <div class="author"> Sebastian Björkqvist </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2024, Washington DC, USA, December 15-18, 2024</em>, Oct 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="davis:2024:decoding-chess-mastery-mechanistic-analysis-chess-language-transformer-model" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Decoding Chess Mastery: A Mechanistic Analysis of a Chess Language Transformer Model</div> <div class="author"> Austin L.

Our findings show that the early layers of the chess transformer correctly identify moves that are highly ranked by the final layer. Experiments conducted on human chess players laid the foundation for much of our current understanding of human problem-solving, cognition, and visual memory.

Aiming to address this limitation, we present Easy2Hard-Bench, a consistently formatted collection of 6 benchmark datasets spanning various domains, such as mathematics and programming problems, chess puzzles, and reasoning questions. Each problem within these datasets is annotated with numerical difficulty scores. To systematically estimate problem difficulties, we collect abundant performance data on attempts to each problem by humans in the real world or LLMs on the prominent leaderboard. Leveraging the rich performance data, we apply well-established difficulty ranking systems, such as Item Response Theory (IRT) and Glicko-2 models, to uniformly assign numerical difficulty scores to problems. Moreover, datasets in Easy2Hard-Bench distinguish themselves from previous collections by a higher proportion of challenging problems. Through extensive experiments with six state-of-the-art LLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of their performance and generalization capabilities across varying levels of difficulty, with the aim of inspiring future research in LLM generalization.

In the current study, focused on the game of chess, we investigated whether chess players could distinguish if they were playing against a human or a computer, and how they achieved this. A total of 24 chess players each played eight 5+0 Blitz games from different starting positions. They played against (1) a human, (2) Maia, a neural network-based chess engine trained to play in a human-like manner, (3) Stockfish 16, the best chess engine available, downgraded to play at a lower level, and (4) Stockfish 16 at its maximal level. The opponent’s move time was fixed at 10 seconds. During the game, participants verbalized their thoughts, and after each game, they indicated by means of a questionnaire whether they thought they had played against a human or a machine and if there were particular moves that revealed the nature of the opponent. The results showed that Stockfish at the highest level was usually correctly identified as an engine, while Maia was often incorrectly identified as a human. The moves of the downgraded Stockfish were relatively often labeled as ‘strange’ by the participants. In conclusion, the Turing test, as applied here in a domain where computers can perform superhumanly, is essentially a test of whether the chess computer can devise suboptimal moves that correspond to human moves, and not necessarily a test of computer intelligence.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="helfenstein:2024:checkmating-one-many-mixture-of-experts-mcts-improve-chess" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Checkmating One, by Using Many: Combining Mixture of Experts with MCTS to Improve in Chess</div> <div class="author"> Felix Helfenstein, Jannis Blüml, Johannes Czech, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Our proposed enhancements are simple to apply by post-processing the output of existing chess engines. The performance of our enhancements was evaluated and compared using two metrics, prediction accuracy and average centipawn loss.

Here we quantify human performance in the popular game of chess by leveraging a very large dataset comprising of over 120 million games between almost 1 million players. We find that individuals encounter hot streaks of repeated success, longer for beginners than for expert players, and even longer cold streaks of unsatisfying performance. Skilled players can be distinguished from the others based on their gaming behaviour. Differences appear from the very first moves of the game, with experts tending to specialize and repeat the same openings while beginners explore and diversify more. However, experts experience a broader response repertoire, and display a deeper understanding of different variations within the same line. Over time, the opening diversity of a player tends to decrease, hinting at the development of individual playing styles. Nevertheless, we find that players are often not able to recognize their most successful openings. Overall, our work contributes to quantifying human performance in competitive settings, providing a first large-scale quantitative analysis of individual careers in chess, helping unveil the determinants separating elite from beginner performance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="de-marzo:2023:complexity-similarity-chess-openings-community-data" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Quantifying the complexity and similarity of chess openings using online chess community data</div> <div class="author"> Giordano De Marzo and Vito D.

In this paper, we use the games played in an online chess platform to exploit the “wisdom of the crowd” and answer questions traditionally tackled only by chess experts. We first define a relatedness network of chess openings that quantifies how similar two openings are to play. Using this network, we identify communities of nodes corresponding to the most common opening choices and their mutual relationships. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the relatedness network can be used to forecast future openings players will start to play, with back-tested predictions outperforming a random predictor. We then apply the Economic Fitness and Complexity algorithm to measure the difficulty of openings and players’ skill levels. Our study not only provides a new perspective on chess analysis but also opens the possibility of suggesting personalized opening recommendations using complex network theory.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="feng:2023:chessgpt-policy-learning-language-modeling" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">ChessGPT: Bridging Policy Learning and Language Modeling</div> <div class="author"> Xidong Feng, Yicheng Luo, Ziyan Wang, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 6 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '6 more authors' ?

As further exploration, we determine what practical values chess pieces and imbalances have at various rating ranges.

The first algorithm makes use of artificial neural networks and manual feature representation thus closely following the implementation and architecture of Matthew Lai’s Giraffe. Giraffe learns to play chess largely by self-play and derives its own rules based on the data [1]. Giraffe was implemented as a 7 class classification problem on a dataset of over 10,000 grandmaster level games. Four different implementations of Giraffe were explored covering two different architectures and the effects of regularization on the model performance. The second algorithm implemented goes through an unsupervised learning phase to perform feature extraction followed by a supervised learning phase thus replicating David Eli’s DeepChess. DeepChess evaluates chess positions using a deep neural network without any a priori knowledge regarding the rules of chess. DeepChess is implemented as a siamese network of two disjoint deep belief networks connected to each other by fully connected layers [2]. This architecture was implemented as a binary classification problem on the same dataset as Giraffe and also on a larger dataset of LiChess games. Different implementations of DeepChess covering different training methodologies and parameter sets were executed.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="bizjak:2021:automatic-recognition-similar-chess-motifs" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Automatic Recognition of Similar Chess Motifs</div> <div class="author"> Miha Bizjak and Matej Guid </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Advances in Computer Games: 17th International Conference, ACG 2021, Virtual Event, November 23–25, 2021, Revised Selected Papers</em>, Feb 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-11488-5_12" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We present a novel method to find chess positions similar to a given query position from a collection of chess games.

By encoding chess tactical problems as text documents, we use information retrieval techniques to enable efficient approximate searches. We have also developed a method for automatically generating tactical puzzles from a collection of chess games. We have experimentally shown the importance of including both static and dynamic features for successful recognition of similar chess motifs. The experiments have clearly shown that dynamic similarity plays a very important role in the evaluation of the similarity of chess motifs by both the program and chess experts.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="bos:2021:improving-chess-elo-system-process-mining" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Improving the Chess Elo System With Process Mining</div> <div class="author"> Niels Bos </div> <div class="periodical"> Jul 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Over the last decade, the amount of data generated by software applications e.g. information systems, websites, mobile applications etc. has increased tremendously. Process mining, a subdiscipline of data science, uses this data to analyse and improve processes. In this research, the possibilities of process mining on chess event logs are explored, to ultimately improve the chess Elo system. The chess Elo system is a widely used and well accepted rating system. The Elo system is, however, flawed in multiple ways. Two major flaws of the Elo system, are its incapability to review a player?s strength and the excessive time needed to gain the appropriate Elo rating. This research explores the potential of process mining to identify chess expertise. To be more specific, multiple process mining techniques are applied on chess event logs, and the generated process models are analysed to identify chess expertise. This research presents a method to analyse the differences between high and low rated players. This is achieved by comparing process models generated from high and low rated chess games. The results show that by comparing the process models differences between high and low rated players can be observed. Process mining is therefore a promising approach to improve the Elo system and might be applicable to other software too. However, only the first twelve moves of a game were used. To gain more insight into the differences between high and low rated players, the mid and end games should be included in the event logs as well. Future research should be conducted with more chess games added to the event logs to increase the validity.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="chowdhury:2021:predicting-chess-openings-modelling-opponents" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Predicting Chess Opening Through Modelling Of Chess Opponents</div> <div class="author"> Debarpan Bose Chowdhury and Banashree Sen </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Webology (ISSN: 1735-188X)</em>, Jul 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="comarela:2021:lightweight-approach-prediction-errors-chess" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A lightweight approach for predicting errors in chess matches</div> <div class="author"> Giovanni Comarela and Davi Silva </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Anais do XVIII Encontro Nacional de Inteligência Artificial e Computacional</em>, Evento Online, Jul 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.5753/eniac.2021.18296" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="czech:2021:improving-alphazero-monte-carlo-graph-search" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Improving AlphaZero Using Monte-Carlo Graph Search</div> <div class="author"> Johannes Czech, Patrick Korus, and Kristian Kersting </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the Thirty-First International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling, ICAPS 2021, Guangzhou, China (virtual), August 2-13, 2021</em>, Jul 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="demeter:2021:probing-learning-representation-language-models-closed-domains" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Who’s on First?: Probing the Learning and Representation Capabilities of Language Models on Deterministic Closed Domains</div> <div class="author"> David Demeter and Doug Downey </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 25th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning</em>, Nov 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2021.conll-1.16" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The capabilities of today’s natural language processing systems are typically evaluated using large datasets of curated questions and answers. While these are critical benchmarks of progress, they also suffer from weakness due to artificial distributions and incomplete knowledge. Artifacts arising from artificial distributions can overstate language model performance, while incomplete knowledge limits fine-grained analysis. In this work, we introduce a complementary benchmarking approach based on SimPlified Language Activity Traces (SPLAT). SPLATs are corpora of language encodings of activity in some closed domain (we study traces from chess and baseball games in this work). SPLAT datasets use naturally-arising distributions, allow the generation of question-answer pairs at scale, and afford complete knowledge in their closed domains. We show that language models of three different architectures can answer questions about world states using only verb-like encodings of activity. Our approach is extensible to new language models and additional question-answering tasks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="holdaway:2021:risk-taking-adversarial-games-what-billion-chess-games-tell-us" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Risk-taking in adversarial games: What can 1 billion online chess games tell us?</div> <div class="author"> Cameron Holdaway and Ed Vul </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, CogSci 2021, virtual, July 26-29, 2021</em>, Nov 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hoque:2022:classification-anomaly-detection-chess" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Classification of Chess Games: An Exploration of Classifiers for Anomaly Detection in Chess</div> <div class="author"> Masudul Hoque </div> <div class="periodical"> Nov 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> https://cornerstone.lib.mnsu.edu/etds/1119/ </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="czech:2020:learning-crazyhouse-above-world-champion-deep-neural-networks-human-data" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Learning to Play the Chess Variant Crazyhouse Above World Champion Level With Deep Neural Networks and Human Data</div> <div class="author"> Johannes Czech, Moritz Willig, Alena Beyer, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

In response to the proliferation of such models, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has sought to develop techniques that enhance the transparency and interpretability of machine learning methods. In this work, we consider a question not previously explored within the XAI and ML communities: Given a computational system whose performance exceeds that of its human user, can explainable AI capabilities be leveraged to improve the performance of the human? We study this question in the context of the game of Chess, for which computational game engines that surpass the performance of the average player are widely available. We introduce the Rationale-Generating Algorithm, an automated technique for generating rationales for utility-based computational methods, which we evaluate with a multi-day user study against two baselines. The results show that our approach produces rationales that lead to statistically significant improvement in human task performance, demonstrating that rationales automatically generated from an AI’s internal task model can be used not only to explain what the system is doing, but also to instruct the user and ultimately improve their task performance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="de-sa-delgado-neto:2019:chess-position-identification" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Chess Position Identification using Pieces Classification Based on Synthetic Images Generation and Deep Neural Network Fine-Tuning</div> <div class="author"> Afonso Sá Delgado Neto and Rafael Mendes Campello </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In 2019 21st Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality (SVR)</em>, Nov 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/SVR.2019.00038" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="guntz:2018:role-emotion-problem-solving" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The role of emotion in problem solving: first results from observing chess</div> <div class="author"> Thomas Guntz, James L.

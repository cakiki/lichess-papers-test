In this paper, we looked at predicting a level’s difficulty and enjoyment. Past work has approached this problem for puzzle games like Sudoku by analyzing the characteristics of the initial level, the solved level, and the process that led to that solution. In this work, we examined a set of heuristics for Roguelike levels and their solutions, and their relationship to subjective player ratings of the levels. We gathered ratings of difficulty and enjoyment of levels in a study with 143 players. We ran an ablation study on the set of heuristics to find the best combination of heuristics for predicting difficulty and enjoyment with a linear regression model, and found solution path-based heursitics performed well. However, these models did not outperform a simple baseline for predicting enjoyment. Jaccard similarity on paths–a method we have not seen used in the field of game AI–was a useful predictor of difficulty. Testing proximity to enemies across a solution path is the only heuristic needed to predict how enjoyable a level will be.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="adnan:2024:unleashing-artificial-cognition-integrating-multiple-ai-systems" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Unleashing Artificial Cognition: Integrating Multiple AI Systems</div> <div class="author"> Muntasir Adnan, Buddhi Gamage, Zhiwei Xu, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

The first algorithm makes use of artificial neural networks and manual feature representation thus closely following the implementation and architecture of Matthew Lai’s Giraffe. Giraffe learns to play chess largely by self-play and derives its own rules based on the data [1]. Giraffe was implemented as a 7 class classification problem on a dataset of over 10,000 grandmaster level games. Four different implementations of Giraffe were explored covering two different architectures and the effects of regularization on the model performance. The second algorithm implemented goes through an unsupervised learning phase to perform feature extraction followed by a supervised learning phase thus replicating David Eli’s DeepChess. DeepChess evaluates chess positions using a deep neural network without any a priori knowledge regarding the rules of chess. DeepChess is implemented as a siamese network of two disjoint deep belief networks connected to each other by fully connected layers [2]. This architecture was implemented as a binary classification problem on the same dataset as Giraffe and also on a larger dataset of LiChess games. Different implementations of DeepChess covering different training methodologies and parameter sets were executed.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="baek:2024:wasm-r3-webassembly-benchmarks" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Wasm-R3: Record-Reduce-Replay for Realistic and Standalone WebAssembly Benchmarks</div> <div class="author"> Doehyun Baek, Jakob Getz, Yusung Sim, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 4 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '4 more authors' ?

Wasm is a portable, compact binary code format with high performance and robust sandboxing properties. As Wasm applications grow in size and importance, the complex performance characteristics of diverse Wasm engines demand robust, representative benchmarks for proper tuning. Stopgap benchmark suites, such as PolyBenchC and libsodium, continue to be used in the literature, though they are known to be unrepresentative. Porting of more complex suites remains difficult because Wasm lacks many system APIs and extracting real-world Wasm benchmarks from the web is difficult due to complex host interactions. To address this challenge, we introduce Wasm-R3, the first record and replay technique for Wasm. Wasm-R3 transparently injects instrumentation into Wasm modules to record an execution trace from inside the module, then reduces the execution trace via several optimizations, and finally produces a replay module that is executable standalone without any host environment-on any engine. The benchmarks created by our approach are (i) realistic, because the approach records real-world web applications, (ii) faithful to the original execution, because the replay benchmark includes the unmodified original code, only adding emulation of host interactions, and (iii) standalone, because the replay benchmarks run on any engine. Applying Wasm-R3 to web-based Wasm applications in the wild demonstrates the correctness of our approach as well as the effectiveness of our optimizations, which reduce the recorded traces by 99.53% and the size of the replay benchmark by 9.98%. We release the resulting benchmark suite of 27 applications, called Wasm-R3-Bench, to the community, to inspire a new generation of realistic and standalone Wasm benchmarks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="banerjee:2024:skill-v-chance-card-board-games" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Skill vs. Chance Quantification for Popular Card &amp; Board Games</div> <div class="author"> Tathagata Banerjee, Anushka De, Subhamoy Maitra, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Our research proposes enhancements of models developed in this vein that more accurately imitate master-level players, as well as improve the prediction accuracy of existing models on weaker players. Our proposed enhancements are simple to apply by post-processing the output of existing chess engines. The performance of our enhancements was evaluated and compared using two metrics, prediction accuracy and average centipawn loss. We found that using an ensemble model over search depths maximised prediction accuracy, while an evaluation window filtering approach was preferable with respect to average centipawn loss.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="bart:2023:can-artificial-intelligence-identify-creativity" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Can artificial intelligence identify creativity?: An empirical study</div> <div class="author"> William Bart </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Creativity</em>, Oct 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjoc.2023.100057" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This article reports an investigation of the extent to which a chess program with an artificial intelligence component (i.e., Stockfish with NNUE) can identify 10 chess moves that are recognized as outstanding chess moves.

Process mining, a subdiscipline of data science, uses this data to analyse and improve processes. In this research, the possibilities of process mining on chess event logs are explored, to ultimately improve the chess Elo system. The chess Elo system is a widely used and well accepted rating system. The Elo system is, however, flawed in multiple ways. Two major flaws of the Elo system, are its incapability to review a player?s strength and the excessive time needed to gain the appropriate Elo rating. This research explores the potential of process mining to identify chess expertise. To be more specific, multiple process mining techniques are applied on chess event logs, and the generated process models are analysed to identify chess expertise. This research presents a method to analyse the differences between high and low rated players. This is achieved by comparing process models generated from high and low rated chess games. The results show that by comparing the process models differences between high and low rated players can be observed. Process mining is therefore a promising approach to improve the Elo system and might be applicable to other software too. However, only the first twelve moves of a game were used. To gain more insight into the differences between high and low rated players, the mid and end games should be included in the event logs as well. Future research should be conducted with more chess games added to the event logs to increase the validity.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="chen:2025:strength-estimation-human-like-strength-adjustment-games" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Strength Estimation and Human-Like Strength Adjustment in Games</div> <div class="author"> Chun Jung Chen, Chung-Chin Shih, and Ti-Rong Wu </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations</em>, Jul 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/strength-estimator/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Website</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Strength estimation and adjustment are crucial in designing human-AI interactions, particularly in games where AI surpasses human players. This paper introduces a novel strength system, including a strength estimator (SE) and an SE-based Monte Carlo tree search, denoted as SE-MCTS, which predicts strengths from games and offers different playing strengths with human styles. The strength estimator calculates strength scores and predicts ranks from games without direct human interaction. SE-MCTS utilizes the strength scores in a Monte Carlo tree search to adjust playing strength and style. We first conduct experiments in Go, a challenging board game with a wide range of ranks. Our strength estimator significantly achieves over 80% accuracy in predicting ranks by observing 15 games only, whereas the previous method reached 49% accuracy for 100 games. For strength adjustment, SE-MCTS successfully adjusts to designated ranks while achieving a 51.33% accuracy in aligning to human actions, outperforming a previous state-of-the-art, with only 42.56% accuracy. To demonstrate the generality of our strength system, we further apply SE and SE-MCTS to chess and obtain consistent results. These results show a promising approach to strength estimation and adjustment, enhancing human-AI interactions in games.

Here we quantify human performance in the popular game of chess by leveraging a very large dataset comprising of over 120 million games between almost 1 million players. We find that individuals encounter hot streaks of repeated success, longer for beginners than for expert players, and even longer cold streaks of unsatisfying performance. Skilled players can be distinguished from the others based on their gaming behaviour. Differences appear from the very first moves of the game, with experts tending to specialize and repeat the same openings while beginners explore and diversify more. However, experts experience a broader response repertoire, and display a deeper understanding of different variations within the same line. Over time, the opening diversity of a player tends to decrease, hinting at the development of individual playing styles. Nevertheless, we find that players are often not able to recognize their most successful openings. Overall, our work contributes to quantifying human performance in competitive settings, providing a first large-scale quantitative analysis of individual careers in chess, helping unveil the determinants separating elite from beginner performance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="chowdhury:2021:predicting-chess-openings-modelling-opponents" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Predicting Chess Opening Through Modelling Of Chess Opponents</div> <div class="author"> Debarpan Bose Chowdhury and Banashree Sen </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Webology (ISSN: 1735-188X)</em>, Feb 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="comarela:2021:lightweight-approach-prediction-errors-chess" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A lightweight approach for predicting errors in chess matches</div> <div class="author"> Giovanni Comarela and Davi Silva </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Anais do XVIII Encontro Nacional de Inteligência Artificial e Computacional</em>, Evento Online, Feb 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.5753/eniac.2021.18296" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="cook:2025:advantage-moving-first-amateur-online-chess" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Advantage of Moving First in Amateur Online Chess</div> <div class="author"> Tyler Cook </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>ICGA Journal</em>, Feb 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13896911251315903" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>There is a long-held belief in the chess community that the player with the white pieces has an advantage in making the first move. This phenomenon has been observed repeatedly in over-the-board games between high-level players and professionals. However, less is known about the prevalence of white’s advantage in games played between amateurs in more casual settings. This article attempts to identify a first-move advantage in chess by examining a large database of amateur games played online on a dedicated chess website. Win rates are calculated for various rating levels, and the influence of opening move choice is also explored. These results can help determine whether there is an inherent first-move advantage in chess observable for all players in multiple settings, or if this effect is exclusively seen with players of high skill during games played in person.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="cruz:2025:understanding-learned-look-ahead-behavior-chess-neural-networks" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Understanding the learned look-ahead behavior of chess neural networks</div> <div class="author"> Diogo Cruz </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>CoRR</em>, Feb 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> keywords from rejected openreview submission: https://openreview.net/forum?id=OcBAd0JPxv&amp;noteId=ZcMfmDpMpn </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/ARXIV.2505.21552" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We investigate the look-ahead capabilities of chess-playing neural networks, specifically focusing on the Leela Chess Zero policy network. We build on the work of Jenner et al. (2024) by analyzing the model’s ability to consider future moves and alternative sequences beyond the immediate next move. Our findings reveal that the network’s look-ahead behavior is highly context-dependent, varying significantly based on the specific chess position. We demonstrate that the model can process information about board states up to seven moves ahead, utilizing similar internal mechanisms across different future time steps. Additionally, we provide evidence that the network considers multiple possible move sequences rather than focusing on a single line of play. These results offer new insights into the emergence of sophisticated look-ahead capabilities in neural networks trained on strategic tasks, contributing to our understanding of AI reasoning in complex domains.

In response to the proliferation of such models, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has sought to develop techniques that enhance the transparency and interpretability of machine learning methods. In this work, we consider a question not previously explored within the XAI and ML communities: Given a computational system whose performance exceeds that of its human user, can explainable AI capabilities be leveraged to improve the performance of the human? We study this question in the context of the game of Chess, for which computational game engines that surpass the performance of the average player are widely available. We introduce the Rationale-Generating Algorithm, an automated technique for generating rationales for utility-based computational methods, which we evaluate with a multi-day user study against two baselines. The results show that our approach produces rationales that lead to statistically significant improvement in human task performance, demonstrating that rationales automatically generated from an AI’s internal task model can be used not only to explain what the system is doing, but also to instruct the user and ultimately improve their task performance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="davis:2024:decoding-chess-mastery-mechanistic-analysis-chess-language-transformer-model" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Decoding Chess Mastery: A Mechanistic Analysis of a Chess Language Transformer Model</div> <div class="author"> Austin L.

Addressing the broader goal of enhancing AI trustworthiness through transparency, accountability, and controllability, we focus on techniques to understand, quantify, and manipulate these latent space representations. Through a series of analyses, we examine several chess-playing GPT models as controlled testbeds, leveraging their structured decision space to explore emergent representations and decision-making processes. Key contributions include a mechanistic analysis of the attention heads and latent representations, the development of novel metrics for evaluating intervention outcomes, and the application of linear probe classifiers to decode and edit the model’s internal world representations. Analysis of the probe weight vectors reveals that the chess-playing GPT developed an emergent world model of the game that includes pieces, positions, and movement rules, and provides empirical support for the linear representation hypothesis–the idea that abstract concepts are encoded as specific directions in the model’s hidden state space. Complementary analysis of the hidden state vectors demonstrates that the model’s internal representations honor the Markovian property of chess. Experimental results demonstrate that linear interventions can causally steer GPT outputs while preserving their semantic validity. Drawing on the dose-response analogy from medicine, we vary both the strength and position of interventions, showing that output quality is maximized when intervention strength follows an exponentially decaying schedule across token positions. Similar experiments using sparse autoencoders in place of linear probes yielded significantly poorer performance. These results highlight the effectiveness of simple linear probes as valuable tools for interpretability and control. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="de-marzo:2023:complexity-similarity-chess-openings-community-data" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Quantifying the complexity and similarity of chess openings using online chess community data</div> <div class="author"> Giordano De Marzo and Vito D.

Opening Theory is one of the pillars of chess and requires years of study to be mastered. In this paper, we use the games played in an online chess platform to exploit the “wisdom of the crowd” and answer questions traditionally tackled only by chess experts. We first define a relatedness network of chess openings that quantifies how similar two openings are to play. Using this network, we identify communities of nodes corresponding to the most common opening choices and their mutual relationships. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the relatedness network can be used to forecast future openings players will start to play, with back-tested predictions outperforming a random predictor. We then apply the Economic Fitness and Complexity algorithm to measure the difficulty of openings and players’ skill levels. Our study not only provides a new perspective on chess analysis but also opens the possibility of suggesting personalized opening recommendations using complex network theory.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="de-sa-delgado-neto:2019:chess-position-identification" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Chess Position Identification using Pieces Classification Based on Synthetic Images Generation and Deep Neural Network Fine-Tuning</div> <div class="author"> Afonso Sá Delgado Neto and Rafael Mendes Campello </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In 2019 21st Symposium on Virtual and Augmented Reality (SVR)</em>, Apr 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/SVR.2019.00038" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="deletang:2024:generative-reinforcement-learning-with-transformers" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Generative Reinforcement Learning with Transformers</div> <div class="author"> Gregoire Deletang, Anian Ruoss, Li Kevin Wenliang, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 5 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '5 more authors' ?

While these are critical benchmarks of progress, they also suffer from weakness due to artificial distributions and incomplete knowledge. Artifacts arising from artificial distributions can overstate language model performance, while incomplete knowledge limits fine-grained analysis. In this work, we introduce a complementary benchmarking approach based on SimPlified Language Activity Traces (SPLAT). SPLATs are corpora of language encodings of activity in some closed domain (we study traces from chess and baseball games in this work). SPLAT datasets use naturally-arising distributions, allow the generation of question-answer pairs at scale, and afford complete knowledge in their closed domains. We show that language models of three different architectures can answer questions about world states using only verb-like encodings of activity. Our approach is extensible to new language models and additional question-answering tasks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="diallo:2025:chessmovellm-large-language-models-chess-next-move-prediction" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">ChessMoveLLM: Large Language Models for Chess Next Move Prediction</div> <div class="author"> Kassim B.

Aiming to address this limitation, we present Easy2Hard-Bench, a consistently formatted collection of 6 benchmark datasets spanning various domains, such as mathematics and programming problems, chess puzzles, and reasoning questions. Each problem within these datasets is annotated with numerical difficulty scores. To systematically estimate problem difficulties, we collect abundant performance data on attempts to each problem by humans in the real world or LLMs on the prominent leaderboard. Leveraging the rich performance data, we apply well-established difficulty ranking systems, such as Item Response Theory (IRT) and Glicko-2 models, to uniformly assign numerical difficulty scores to problems. Moreover, datasets in Easy2Hard-Bench distinguish themselves from previous collections by a higher proportion of challenging problems. Through extensive experiments with six state-of-the-art LLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of their performance and generalization capabilities across varying levels of difficulty, with the aim of inspiring future research in LLM generalization.

In the current study, focused on the game of chess, we investigated whether chess players could distinguish if they were playing against a human or a computer, and how they achieved this. A total of 24 chess players each played eight 5+0 Blitz games from different starting positions. They played against (1) a human, (2) Maia, a neural network-based chess engine trained to play in a human-like manner, (3) Stockfish 16, the best chess engine available, downgraded to play at a lower level, and (4) Stockfish 16 at its maximal level. The opponent’s move time was fixed at 10 seconds. During the game, participants verbalized their thoughts, and after each game, they indicated by means of a questionnaire whether they thought they had played against a human or a machine and if there were particular moves that revealed the nature of the opponent. The results showed that Stockfish at the highest level was usually correctly identified as an engine, while Maia was often incorrectly identified as a human. The moves of the downgraded Stockfish were relatively often labeled as ‘strange’ by the participants. In conclusion, the Turing test, as applied here in a domain where computers can perform superhumanly, is essentially a test of whether the chess computer can devise suboptimal moves that correspond to human moves, and not necessarily a test of computer intelligence.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="feng:2023:chessgpt-policy-learning-language-modeling" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">ChessGPT: Bridging Policy Learning and Language Modeling</div> <div class="author"> Xidong Feng, Yicheng Luo, Ziyan Wang, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 6 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '6 more authors' ?

In this study, 28 high school students who were active in chess and participated in provincial and national chess leagues were selected. Based on the NEO Five-Factor Inventory of personality traits, they were divided into two groups: 14 extroverted students (17 \pm 0.88) and 14 introverted students (16.5 \pm 1.02). Each participant attended three separate sessions in the laboratory, with a minimum 72-hour rest period between sessions. In each session, participants performed the Iowa Gambling Task and the Lichess computer game before any stimulation. They were then subjected to one of three conditions: right anodal/left cathodal, right cathodal/left anodal, or sham stimulation, for 20 minutes at 2 mA intensity over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. After the stimulation, participants repeated the Iowa Gambling Task and the Lichess computer game. Data analysis using two-way mixed ANOVA revealed a significant difference in the Iowa Gambling Task between right anodal/left cathodal and right cathodal/left anodal stimulation based on personality traits (p = 0.001). The findings of this study indicated that transcranial direct current stimulation had a differential effect on decision-making in chess players based on their personality traits. Specifically, the study’s results showed that extroverted players exhibited more risk-taking behaviour, while introverted players acted more cautiously.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="giadikiaroglou:2025:investgiating-capabilities-language-models-puzzles" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Investigating the capabilities of language models in puzzle reasoning: A survey and experimental analysis</div> <div class="author"> Panagiotis Giadikiaroglou </div> <div class="periodical"> Mar 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.26240/heal.ntua.29165" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Puzzle-solving has long served as a benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence, testing a model’s ability to reason, infer, and strategize across complex problem spaces. Traditional AI and machine learning methods, such as symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning, have made notable strides in structured domains like board games and logic puzzles. However, as neural networks and, more recently, large language models (LLMs) have evolved, new possibilities have emerged for tackling a broader range of puzzle types, including those requiring nuanced commonsense reasoning, abstract pattern recognition, and complex multi-step calculations. LLMs, with their vast data-driven language capabilities, hold unique potential to bridge structured logical tasks and less formal, knowledge-based puzzles. Despite these advances, the current landscape of puzzle-solving with LLMs reveals both achievements and limitations, particularly when models are tasked with problems that demand interpretative reasoning and precise calculation. This thesis explores the evolving role of LLMs in solving such complex reasoning tasks, specifically focusing on their puzzle-solving capabilities. Divided into two main sections, the thesis first provides a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in LLM methodologies, covering diverse prompting techniques, neuro-symbolic approaches, and fine-tuning strategies for puzzles. Using a newly proposed taxonomy, puzzles are categorized into rule-based and rule-less types, with each category examined for its unique cognitive demands on LLMs. The second section presents experimental evaluations conducted on four datasets–two math-based datasets (GSM8K, SVAMP) and two puzzle-focused datasets (Game of 24 and RiddleSense). Various reasoning techniques, including Input-Output (IO) prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (LtM), and Faithful-CoT methods, are employed to assess LLM performance. Models of varying scales, particularly smaller LLMs like Llama-3.1 family and Mistral, are tested across settings such as zero-shot, few-shot, and self-consistency to evaluate their efficacy in solving complex and multi-step reasoning tasks. The thesis provides critical insights into the performance limitations of current LLMs in puzzle-solving, particularly noting that advanced reasoning methods like Faithful-CoT and puzzle translation techniques yield inconsistent improvements with smaller models. Finally, it outlines future research directions, advocating for expanded dataset creation, neuro-symbolic integration, and advancements in puzzle generation. This thesis aims to deepen our understanding of LLMs’ reasoning abilities and highlight pathways to enhance their performance in complex cognitive tasks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="guntz:2018:role-emotion-problem-solving" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The role of emotion in problem solving: first results from observing chess</div> <div class="author"> Thomas Guntz, James L.

Both platforms feature extensive app stores with millions of applications available for download. While security measures are in place to prevent the distribution of malicious or vulnerable apps, instances of malware have still been discovered in both stores. These incidents highlight a significant security risk that threatens user privacy and highlights the urgent need for advanced research in detecting malicious code and security vulnerabilities in mobile applications. As a step toward addressing this challenge, this thesis explores the feasibility of using binary similarity detection techniques to identify similarities between Android and iOS applications. To achieve this, we designed and implemented a novel analysis pipeline specifically tailored for comparing Android apps (compiled into binary OAT files) with iOS binaries. This pipeline enables the automatic identification of matches between corresponding applications across both platforms. The pipeline comprises several key stages, including preparing the apps and their third-party libraries for binary analysis, disassembling the binaries using both IDA Pro and Ghidra to account for potential variations introduced by different disassemblers, and conducting similarity analysis on the disassembly results. To assess the effectiveness of our pipeline, we conducted a comprehensive analysis on a dataset of 100 cross-platform apps. Our findings indicate that current binary similarity analysis methods have limitations in directly identifying cross-platform similarities between applications. However, we demonstrated that incorporating third-party libraries into the analysis significantly enhances similarity detection and can help to provide meaningful insights. This highlights the crucial role that third-party libraries play in cross-platform app analysis. Additionally, we found that the choice of disassembler has a significant impact on analysis results. Notably, no single disassembler proved to be clearly superior, as both exhibited their own strengths and limitations. Ultimately, this study offers valuable insights into the challenges and potential of cross-platform binary app analysis using traditional binary diffing techniques, laying a strong foundation for future research in this evolving field.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="knopps:collaborative-vs-individual-chess-puzzle-solving" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Collaborative versus Individual Chess Puzzle Solving</div> <div class="author"> Alex Knopps </div> <div class="periodical"> Feb 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="krishnan:2022:automatic-synthesis-interpretable-chess-tactics" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Towards the automatic synthesis of interpretable chess tactics</div> <div class="author"> Abhijeet Krishnan and Chris Martens </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the Explainable Agency in Artificial Intelligence Workshop, 36th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</em>, Mar 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="krishnan:2022:synthesizing-interpretable-chess-tactics-player-games" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Synthesizing interpretable chess tactics from player games</div> <div class="author"> Abhijeet Krishnan and Chris Martens </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Strategy Games (SG) and Esports Analytics (EA), 18th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment</em>, Oct 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="kuboki:2025:policies-multiple-skill-levels-better-strength-estimation-games" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Policies of Multiple Skill Levels for Better Strength Estimation in Games</div> <div class="author"> Kyota Kuboki, Tatsuyoshi Ogawa, Chu-Hsuan Hsueh, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

Even in complex situations with many possible courses of action, people are able to make good decisions. Recent proposals suggest that a primary contributor to this efficiency is the intelligent use of cognitive resources, but how people allocate these resources under time constraints is not fully understood. In this work, we conduct a resource-rational analysis of planning in a large data set of online chess games. We first demonstrate that players spent more time thinking when they had more time to do so, and that this effect was especially prevalent when computation was more valuable. Then, we show that additional time spent planning resulted in better selected moves when one existed, and compare between signals of general and immediate time pressure. Finally, we highlight the role of expertise in this setting.

Object recognition in images is one area where computer vision can contribute to significant improvements. Playing chess, one of the oldest and most challenging intellectual games requires concentration and tactical thinking. In computer vision, automating the recognition of chessboards and figures can contribute to developing advanced chess applications, help users analyse games, or even enable a game with a computer based on real-world chess setups. This paper describes how the system for recognising chessboards and figures using computer vision techniques was developed and implemented. Through analysing existing methods, designing a new algorithm, and experimental evaluation, the goal is to create an accurate and efficient system that can recognise chess positions and individual figures based on images.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="lennart:2024:few-shot-embedding-learning-approach-predicting-behvaior-individual-chess-players" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Few-Shot Embedding Learning Approach for Predicting the Behavior of Individual Chess Players</div> <div class="author"> Lennart August </div> <div class="periodical"> Aug 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This study presents a few-shot embedding learning approach to predict the behavior of individual chess players, based on only 100 games. Traditional models have relied on extensive datasets, often requiring thousands of games to achieve accurate move predictions. In contrast, our method leverages a limited number of games to generate dense vector representations, or embeddings, that capture a player’s unique style. We trained a neural network to create these embeddings and used them to predict subsequent moves. Our results indicate that the embedding model performs well across various player sets and can accurately identify players even at scale among a great player population, picking out players with 84% accuracy from among 100k candidates. There are indications that including information on the clock situation during the game improves the embedding process, although our findings are inconclusive. Despite these limitations, our approach shows promise in making personalized chess training more accessible and highlights the potential for embedding learning in human-centered AI applications. Future work will aim to refine both the embedding and move prediction models and explore its application in other domains.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="lequenne:2025:characterizing-chess-player-styles-neural-networks-embeddings-stockfish" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Characterizing Chess Player Styles with Neural Network Embeddings from Stockfish</div> <div class="author"> Victor Lequenne </div> <div class="periodical"> Aug 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This thesis investigates how neural networks can be used to analyze and compare chess player styles.

We apply dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, MDS) and clustering (K-means) to build style-based player maps, measuring similarities through Jensen–Shannon divergence. Results show consistent stylistic signatures for some players–such as Firouzja and Dubov but may fail with others e.g. Nepomniachtchi.

Our goal is to provide a theory of Gambits. A Gambit is a combination of psychological and technical factors designed to disrupt predictable play. Chess provides an environment to study gambits and behavioral game theory. Our theory is based on the Bellman optimality path for sequential decision-making. This allows us to calculate the Q\ Q \\-values of a Gambit where material (usually a pawn) is sacrificed for dynamic play. On the empirical side, we study the effectiveness of a number of popular chess Gambits. This is a natural setting as chess Gambits require a sequential assessment of a set of moves (a.k.a. policy) after the Gambit has been accepted. Our analysis uses Stockfish 14.1 to calculate the optimal Bellman Q\ Q \\-values, which fundamentally measures if a position is winning or losing. To test whether Bellman’s equation holds in play, we estimate the transition probabilities to the next board state via a database of expert human play. This then allows us to test whether the Gambiteer is following the optimal path in his decision-making. Our methodology is applied to the popular Stafford and reverse Stafford (a.k.a. Boden–Kieretsky–Morphy) Gambit and other common ones including the Smith–Morra, Goring, Danish and Halloween Gambits. We build on research in human decision-making by proving an irrational skewness preference within agents in chess.

Through rigorous experimentation, including self-play, matchups against a variant of the renowned program, Go-deep experiments, and score deviations, we present compelling evidence for the effectiveness of a weighted sum of both evaluations. Remarkably, in our experiments, the combination of 75% neural network and 25% traditional evaluation consistently emerged as the most effective choice.

This paper presents a novel approach to chess cheater detection that combines conventional chess engines and neural networks to help identify which games are authentically played by humans and which show signs of extraneous intervention. By utilizing Stockfish to measure centipawn loss and its mathematical derivatives, we can measure deviations from typical computer-generated moves much like in conventional anti-cheat systems. Additionally, the neural network Maia, designed specifically to mimic human play, transmutes centipawn loss data to highlight deviations from human style. This dual-measurement system addresses the limitations of the given traditional anti-cheat systems, which face the issue of distinguishing between strong human players and those using engines. The collected metadata is analyzed using a sequential neural network, which identifies patterns of fair play violation. Our approach offers a robust solution for maintaining the integrity of online chess by accurately detecting and preventing cheating.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="martin:2025:re-evaluating-metamorphic-testing-chess-engines-replication-study" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Re-evaluating metamorphic testing of chess engines: A replication study</div> <div class="author"> Axel Martin, Djamel Eddine Khelladi, Théo Matricon, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

Initial findings, under conditions strictly identical to those of the original study, corroborate the reported inconsistencies. Objective: However, the original article considers a specific dataset (including randomly generated chess positions, end-games, or checkmate problems) and very low analysis depth (10 plies11A ply refers to a single turn taken by one player in a game. Two plies, one from each player, together constitute a complete move., corresponding to 5 moves). These decisions pose threats that limit generalizability of the results, but also their practical usefulness both for chess players and maintainers of Stockfish. Thus, we replicate the original study. Methods: We consider this time (1) positions derived from actual chess games, (2) analyses at appropriate and larger depths, and (3) different versions of Stockfish. We conduct novel experiments on thousands of positions, employing significantly deeper searches. Results: The replication results show that the Stockfish chess engines demonstrate significantly greater consistency in its evaluations. The metamorphic relations are not as effective as in the original article, especially on realistic chess positions. We also demonstrate that, for any given position, there exists a depth threshold beyond which further increases in depth do not result in any evaluation differences for the studied metamorphic relations. We perform an in-depth analysis to identify and clarify the implementation reasons behind Stockfish’s inconsistencies when dealing with transformed positions. Conclusion: A first concrete result is thus that metamorphic testing of chess engines is not yet an effective technique for finding faults of Stockfish. Another result is the lessons learned through this replication effort: metamorphic relations must be verified in the context of the domain’s specificities; without such contextual validation, they may lead to misleading or irrelevant conclusions; changes in parameters and input dataset can drastically alter the effectiveness of a testing method.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="mcilroy-young:2020:aligning-superhuman-ai-human-behavior" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Aligning Superhuman AI with Human Behavior: Chess as a Model System</div> <div class="author"> Reid McIlroy-Young, Siddhartha Sen, Jon M.

A central question in the literature studying these problematic effects is whether they are associated with the amount of time users spend on online platforms. This is often addressed by either analyzing self-reported measures of time spent online, which are generally inaccurate, or using objective metrics derived from server logs or tracking software. Nonetheless, how the two types of time measures comparatively relate to problematic effects – whether they complement or are redundant with each other in predicting problematicity – remains unknown. Additionally, transparent research into this question is hindered by the literature’s focus on closed platforms with inaccessible data, as well as selective analytical decisions that may lead to reproducibility issues.In this work, we investigate how both self-reported and data-derived metrics of time spent relate to potentially problematic effects arising from the use of an open, non-profit online chess platform. These effects include disruptions to sleep, relationships, school and work performance, and self-control. To this end, we distributed a gamified survey to players and linked their responses with publicly-available game logs. We find problematic effects to be associated with both self-reported and data-derived usage measures to similar degrees. However, analytical models incorporating both self-reported and actual time explain problematic effects significantly more effectively than models with either type of measure alone. Furthermore, these results persist across thousands of possible analytical decisions when using a robust and transparent statistical framework. This suggests that the two methods of measuring time spent measure contain distinct, complementary information about problematic usage outcomes and should be used in conjunction with each other.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="mok:2024:measuring-digital-welfare-online-systems" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Measuring the Digital Welfare of Online Social Systems</div> <div class="author"> Lillio Mok </div> <div class="periodical"> Apr 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> http://hdl.handle.net/1807/140863 </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="mondal:2025:adaptive-decision-making-in-the-wild-case-study-chess" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Adaptive decision making in the wild: a case study of chess</div> <div class="author"> Supratik Mondal and Jakub Traczyk </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Thinking &amp; Reasoning</em>, Apr 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13546783.2025.2550306" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Chess is a game of strategic thinking and time management, where a player can lose a game on time despite making all the best moves. Finding the best move is a deliberate and energy-intensive process in a game where players are often under time pressure. Therefore, players who can balance this trade-off will have a significant advantage. The current study explores such instances where winning is contingent on how well players balance their accuracy under time pressure. We found that winning players, compared to their opponents, followed a more adaptive decision strategy–they made more theoretical best moves (i.e., accurate moves) in highly critical positions. However, the accuracy difference between the opponents was very similar in less critical positions. We conclude that winning players have a better understanding of when and how to allocate their limited resources efficiently, even when controlling for differences in skill levels, compared to their opponents.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="morelbalbi:2025:learning-rank-estimation-partial-sparse-noisy-comparisons" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Learning when to rank: Estimation of partial rankings from sparse, noisy comparisons</div> <div class="author"> Sebastian Morel-Balbi and Alec Kirkley </div> <div class="periodical"> Apr 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="muecke:2022:check-mate-sanity-check-trustworthy-ai" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Check Mate: A Sanity Check for Trustworthy AI</div> <div class="author"> Sascha Mücke and Lukas Pfahler </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the LWDA 2022 Workshops: FGWM, FGKD, and FGDB, Hildesheim (Germany), Oktober 5-7th, 2022</em>, Apr 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="mujagic:2024:predictive-analysis-chess-player-performance-maching-learning" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Predictive Analysis of Chess Player Performance: An Analysis of Factors Influencing Competitive Success Using Machine Learning Techniques</div> <div class="author"> Amar Mujagić, Adnan Mujagić, and Dželila Mehanović </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Advanced Technologies, Systems, and Applications IX</em>, Apr 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The world of competitive chess has long been a captivating arena for intellectual competition, where human intelligence, strategic thinking, and long-term planning converge.

Our analysis highlights scenarios where security schemes are featured in APIs in different proportions over time, thus tracking whether the API documentation tends to include more (or less) security details as the API evolves.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="narayanan:2023:improving-strength-human-models-chess" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Improving the Strength of Human-Like Models in Chess</div> <div class="author"> Saumik Narayanan, Kassa Korley, Chien-Ju Ho, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

There has been some exploration of their application to non-linguistic tasks, which could lead to significant advancements in fields that rely heavily on structured data and specialized knowledge. However, there has been limited direct comparison of the effects of model adaptation techniques for non-linguistic compared to linguistic tasks with LLMs. To this end, the work in this paper investigates the effects of fine-tuning and few-shot learning on pre-trained LLMs for non-linguistic tasks using chess puzzles as a case study task. We compare the impact of fine-tuning and few-shot learning on models performing the same task represented in both chess notation (i.e., non-linguistic data) and natural language descriptions of the same chess notations (i.e., natural language data). Our experiments with Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1 and Meta-Llama-3-70B resulted in a 5% lower average increase in performance after fine-tuning for non-linguistic tasks compared to linguistic tasks. Similarly, few-shot learning on pre-trained models exhibited a 3% lower average increase in performance for on non-linguistic tasks compared to linguistic tasks. Furthermore, few-shot learning on fine-tuned models resulted in a significant accuracy drop, particularly for Mixtral, with a 24.82% decrease for non-linguistic tasks. These results suggest that fine-tuning and few-shot learning for generative LLMs have stronger effects on linguistic tasks and their data than for non-linguistic.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="nie:2024:discovering-high-quality-chess-puzzles-offline-reinforcement-learning" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Discovering High-Quality Chess Puzzles Through One Billion Plays with Offline Reinforcement Learning</div> <div class="author"> Allen Nie, Anirudhan Badrinath, Nicholas Tomlin, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 5 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '5 more authors' ?

At the same time, these developers use different communication channels, such as the GitHub issue tracker. Although GitHub issues are accessible and manageable for developers, their content often differs starkly from what users write in app reviews. Issues may lack steps to reproduce bugs or insights that justify the priority of new feature requests. The sheer volume of user reviews for a popular app, combined with their heterogeneity and varying quality, makes manual integration into issue trackers unfeasible. We present an approach that automatically augments GitHub issues with informative user reviews to bridge the gap between user feedback and developer-managed issues. Using a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM), our approach automatically retrieves user reviews with high semantic textual similarity (STS) to the issue content and suggests reviews that augment developers’ understanding of the issue. In this paper, we present large-scale quantitative and qualitative analyses to assess the feasibility of enriching development workflows with user-written information. Using over 37,000 issues and 750,000 reviews from 19 popular Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) mobile applications, our approach augments 3,017 (8%) issues with 7,287 (1%) potentially informative reviews. In addition to providing insights into user-reported bugs and feature requests, the information from these matches points toward a novel and promising way to leverage user reviews for concerted app evolution.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="puri:2020:explain-your-move" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Explain Your Move: Understanding Agent Actions Using Specific and Relevant Feature Attribution</div> <div class="author"> Nikaash Puri, Sukriti Verma, Piyush Gupta, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 4 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '4 more authors' ?

However, the sense of stopping and making decisions in such frameworks is highly platonic, with both decisions and stopping actions occurring instantaneously. In contrast, the phenomenology of quitting actions that one is undertaking appears to be temporally extended and metacognitively challenging. We study the metacognitive covariates of quitting decisions made by chess players using a large database of chess games sourced from an online chess portal. Our analysis reveals that players tend to persevere when they are playing against stronger opponents and after having played poor moves. We also find that a history of quitting games makes players more likely to quit in future games, but that having recently quit in a game offers some protective effect against quitting. Finally, we find that quitting a game makes it more likely that a player will play a game again soon. We place these results in the context of modeling quitting as a metacognitive choice affected by multiple competing goals.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="purohit:2025:skill-issue-quit-chess" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">’Sounds like a skill issue’: what makes you quit at chess?</div> <div class="author"> Hariharan Purohit and Nisheeth Srivastava </div> <div class="periodical"> Mar 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="qian:2020:comparative-study-online-chess-educational-products" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A Comparative Study of Chess Online Educational Products</div> <div class="author"> Qian Dong and Rong Miao </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Blended Learning.

In this paper we present a technique which connects game embeddings, a recent method for modelling game dynamics from log data, and word embeddings, which models semantic information about language. We explain two different approaches for using game embeddings in this way, and show evidence that game embeddings enhance the linguistic translations of game concepts from one theme to another, opening up exciting new possibilities for reasoning about the thematic elements of games in the future.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="rafaralahy:2024-pairwise-ltr-chess-puzzle-difficulty-prediction" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Pairwise Learning to Rank for Chess Puzzle Difficulty Prediction</div> <div class="author"> Andry Rafaralahy </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2024, Washington DC, USA, December 15-18, 2024</em>, Mar 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="reyes:2025:elometrics-advanced-outcome-prediction-chess-elo-ratings-logistic-regression" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">EloMetrics: Advanced Outcome Prediction for Chess Matches with Elo Ratings and Logistic Regression</div> <div class="author"> Ma.

Chess agents designed for human-agent play are capable of adjusting their level, however their style is not aligned with that of human players. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for designing such agents by integrating the theory of chess players’ decision-making with a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach using two sets of analyses. Quantitatively, we establish that the agents attain their desired Elo ratings. Qualitatively, through a Turing-inspired test with a human chess expert, we show that our agents are indistinguishable from human players.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="ruoss:2024:amortized-planning-transformers-case-study-chess" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Amortized Planning with Large-Scale Transformers: A Case Study on Chess</div> <div class="author"> Anian Ruoss, Gregoire Deletang, Sourabh Medapati, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 7 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '7 more authors' ?

Recent proposals have suggested that the key to this cognitive efficiency is intelligent selection of the situations in which computational resources are spent. We tested this hypothesis in the domain of complex planning by analyzing how humans managed time available for thinking in over 12 million online chess matches. We found that players spent more time thinking in board positions where planning was more beneficial. This effect was greater in stronger players, and additionally strengthened by considering only the information available to the player at the time of choice. Finally, we found that the qualitative features of this relationship were consistent with a policy that considers the empirically-measured cost of spending time in chess. This provides evidence that human efficiency is supported by intelligent selection of when to apply computation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="russel:2025:beyond-workload-paving-road-next-generation-implicit-prefrontal-cortex-brain-computer-interface" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Beyond Workload: Paving the Road for the Next Generation of Implicit Prefrontal Cortex Based Brain-Computer Interfaces</div> <div class="author"> Matthew Russell </div> <div class="periodical"> Apr 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> Second two keywords are from the defense page: https://www.cs.tufts.edu/t/colloquia/current/?event=1651 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The rapidly evolving field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) faces a fundamental constraint: the limited bandwidth of information exchange between users and computing systems. One promising approach to increasing this bandwidth is implicit interaction: a paradigm in which applications modify their state based on information gleaned from users, rather than direct input. Within the context of reading such information from human neural signals, this concept is formally recognized as implicit Brain-Computer Interfaces (implicit BCI). My work focuses on implicit BCIs which measure the prefrontal cortex (PFC); early prototypes have successfully leveraged the PFC to approximate mental workload, but much is left to be understood about the full potential of this region. Through three research projects spanning two brain measurement modalities, this dissertation makes targeted contributions to this area of research. With functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), I explore two facets of PFC activation demonstrated in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)-based neuroscience research which are underexplored in applied contexts: episodic memory and brain-network based classification; in the first project, I study the measurable effects of episodic and working memory within the context of using Large Language Models (LLMs), and in the second project I develop a real-time implicit BCI designed to differentiate between different brain networks. The third project benchmarks low-cost EEG in three studies which distinguish brain states based on different factors: quality of moves made during chess playing, workload levels within standard cognitive psychology tasks, and cognitive states during the tasks. For all studies I use Linear Mixed Models (LMM) to observe macro patterns in the data, and machine learning to explore potential for implicit BCI. Results indicate that, in addition to the well-understood concept of measuring singular aspects of consciousness across a gradient (e.g. workload), promising potential exists for leveraging the PFC towards classification across tasks which engage different cognitive processes, both with fNIRS and low-cost EEG. Further, careful consideration of “noise” in implicit BCI introduces a new idea: Human-Sensor-Computer Interaction (HSCI). Taken together, this dissertation provides relevant context to inform the next generation of Human-Sensor-Computer systems, including PFC-based interfaces stretching past workload, and beyond.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="russell:2025:decoding-chess-puzzle-play-bci-eeg-study" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Decoding Chess Puzzle Play and Standard Cognitive Tasks for BCI: A Low-Cost EEG Study</div> <div class="author"> Matthew Russell, Samuel Youkeles, William Xia, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

The method that we present aims to train different ANN architectures to understand chess positions similarly to how highly rated human players do. We investigate the capabilities that ANNs have when it comes to pattern recognition, an ability that distinguishes chess grandmasters from more amateurplayers. We collect around 3,000,000 different chess positions played by highly skilled chess players and label them with the evaluation function of Stockfish, one of the strongest existing chess engines. We create 4 different datasets from scratch that are used for different classification and regression experiments. The results show how relatively simple Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) outperform Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in all the experiments that we have performed. We also investigate two different board representations, the first one representing if a piece is present on the board or not, and the second one in which we assign a numerical value to the piece according to its strength. Our results show how the latter input representation influences the performances of the ANNs negatively in almost all experiments.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="saha:2024:valued-vision-logical-understanding-dataset" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">VALUED - Vision and Logical Understanding Evaluation Dataset</div> <div class="author"> Soumadeep Saha, Saptarshi Saha, and Utpal Garain </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Data-centric Machine Learning Research</em>, Jan 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="saha:2025:domain-obedient-deep-learning" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Domain Obedient Deep Learning</div> <div class="author"> Soumadeep Saha </div> <div class="periodical"> Jan 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> Check if http://hdl.handle.net/10263/7608 works and replace url </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Deep learning, a family of data-driven artificial intelligence techniques, has shown immense promise in a plethora of applications, and it has even outpaced experts in several domains. However, unlike symbolic approaches to learning, these methods fall short when it comes to abiding by and learning from pre-existing established principles. This is a significant deficit for deployment in critical applications such as robotics, medicine, industrial automation, etc. For a decision system to be considered for adoption in such fields, it must demonstrate the ability to adhere to specified constraints, an ability missing in deep learning-based approaches. Exploring this problem serves as the core tenet of this dissertation. This dissertation starts with an exploration of the abilities of conventional deep learning-based systems vis-à-vis domain coherence. A large-scale rule-annotated dataset is introduced to mitigate the pronounced lack of suitable constraint adherence evaluation benchmarks, and with its aid, the rule adherence abilities of vision systems are analyzed. Additionally, this study probes language models to elicit their performance characteristics with regard to domain consistency. Examination of these language models with interventions illustrates their ineptitude at obeying domain principles, and a mitigation strategy is proposed. This is followed by an exploration of techniques for imbuing deep learning systems with domain constraint information. Also, a comprehensive study of standard evaluation metrics and their blind spots pertaining to domain-aware performance estimation is undertaken. Finally, a novel technique to enforce constraint compliance in models without training is introduced, which pairs a search strategy with large language models to achieve cutting-edge performance. A key highlight of this dissertation is the emphasis on addressing pertinent real-world problems with scalable and practicable solutions. We hope the results presented here pave the way for wider adoption of deep learning-based systems in pivotal situations with enhanced confidence in their trustworthiness.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="salant:2022:complexity-satisficing-theory-evidence-chess" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Complexity and Satisficing: Theory with Evidence from Chess</div> <div class="author"> Yuval Salant and Jorg L Spenkuch </div> <div class="periodical"> Apr 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.3386/w30002" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We develop a satisficing model of choice in which the available alternatives differ in their inherent complexity.

We confirm the predictions of the satisficing model–and thus reject maximization–in a novel data set with information on hundreds of millions of real-world chess moves by highly experienced players.

Evidence for this includes correct puzzle solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence until late in the network.

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the impact of custom notation systems and tokenisation methods specifically designed for use with chess games. The study aims to improve the models’ understanding of game states and move sequences by developing and implementing a custom notation system, xLAN+. This notation system incorporates additional information about captures, checks and checkmates in order to increase the performance of the models. Furthermore, the strategic gameplay capabilities of the models are to be enhanced by fine-tuning them on datasets filtered by Elo rating. This approach postulates that filtering games by skill level can help models develop a deeper understanding of strategic gameplay, thereby improving their ability to generate high-quality moves. The research uses two different architectures, Transformer, based on OpenAI’s GPT-2 configuration, and Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) optimised for long sequence processing. Initial findings indicate that the custom notation xLAN+ significantly improves the models’ ability to generate valid moves and maintain game state accuracy over extended sequences. The comparison between GPT-2 and Mamba reveals that while both architectures can learn chess rules and generate plausible moves, the SSM offers slight advantages in handling long-range dependencies and maintaining game context. This project demonstrates the potential of language models to learn complex tasks like chess through data-driven approaches, paving the way for their application in other strategic and decision-making domains.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="schroedter:2025:role-expertise-impulsivity-preference-intuition-decision-quality" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The role of expertise, impulsivity, and preference for intuition on decision quality</div> <div class="author"> Robin Schrödter, Katrin Heyers, Jan Birkemeyer, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

This study introduces an innovative paradigm that leverages the objective assessment capabilities of artificial intelligence in a naturalistic online chess setting. Ninety-four participants evaluated tactical chess positions and identified optimal moves under various time control conditions, followed by personality assessments. Expertise, measured by online Elo rating, emerged as a key predictor, accounting for 55 % of the variance in decision quality and 61 % in evaluation accuracy, underscoring the precision of the chosen approach. The study also highlights the significant impact of time control on decision-making. Additionally, the paradigm shows promise in examining the interplay between personality factors and decision-making processes, with a notable correlation between higher impulsivity scores and faster response times. However, high impulsivity was not associated with reduced decision quality, raising questions about the validity of this measurement. Overall, the results suggest that the chess paradigm, accessible to a broad sample due to the widespread appeal of online chess, provides a powerful tool that combines laboratory precision with real-world relevance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="schuett:2024:estimating-chess-puzzle-difficulty-without-past-records-using-neural-network" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Estimating Chess Puzzle Difficulty Without Past Game Records Using a Human Problem-Solving Inspired Neural Network Architecture</div> <div class="author"> Anan Schütt, Tobias Huber, and Elisabeth André </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2024, Washington DC, USA, December 15-18, 2024</em>, Apr 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="schultz:2024:mastering-board-games-external-internal-planning-language-models" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Mastering Board Games by External and Internal Planning with Language Models</div> <div class="author"> John Schultz, Jakub Adamek, Matej Jusup, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 13 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '13 more authors' ?

We present Caïssa AI, a neuro-symbolic chess agent that augments LLM-generated move commentary with symbolic reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and verification modules. Caïssa AI combines a fine-tuned chess-specific LLM with a Prolog-based rule engine encoding chess tactics and rules, along with a dynamically constructed Neo4j knowledge graph representing the current board state. This hybrid architecture enables the system to generate not only accurate move suggestions but also coherent, strategically grounded commentary. A LangGraph-based verification module cross-checks LLM outputs against symbolic logic to ensure consistency and correctness, effectively mitigating hallucinations. By aligning data-driven generation with formal domain knowledge, Caïssa AI enhances both trustworthiness and explainability. Our results demonstrate that this tight neuro-symbolic integration produces verifiable, high-quality commentary and serves as a generalizable blueprint for AI systems requiring real-time, interpretable decision support.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="song:2023:investigation-sicilian-defense" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Investigation of the Sicilian Defense: Winning rates and strategic discrimination</div> <div class="author"> Ziming Song </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Interdisciplinary Humanities and Communication Studies</em>, Jun 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="stanek:2024:bad-crypto-chessography-weak-randomness-chess-games" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Bad Crypto: Chessography and Weak Randomness of Chess Games</div> <div class="author"> Martin Stanek </div> <div class="periodical"> Jun 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="stockl:2021:watching-language-model-learning-chess" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Watching a Language Model Learning Chess</div> <div class="author"> Andreas Stöckl </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP 2021)</em>, Sep 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We analyse how a transformer-based language model learns the rules of chess from text data of recorded games.

However, model size does not show such a clear influence. It is also interesting to observe that the usual evaluation metrics for language models, predictive accuracy and perplexity, give no indication of this here.

This introduces the possibility of algorithmically-informed teaching in these domains through more relatable AI partners and deeper insights into human decision-making. Critical to achieving this goal, however, is coherently modeling human behavior at various skill levels. Chess is an ideal model system for conducting research into this kind of human-AI alignment, with its rich history as a pivotal testbed for AI research, mature superhuman AI systems like AlphaZero, and precise measurements of skill via chess rating systems. Previous work in modeling human decision-making in chess uses completely independent models to capture human style at different skill levels, meaning they lack coherence in their ability to adapt to the full spectrum of human improvement and are ultimately limited in their effectiveness as AI partners and teaching tools. In this work, we propose a unified modeling approach for human-AI alignment in chess that coherently captures human style across different skill levels and directly captures how people improve. Recognizing the complex, non-linear nature of human learning, we introduce a skill-aware attention mechanism to dynamically integrate players’ strengths with encoded chess positions, enabling our model to be sensitive to evolving player skill. Our experimental results demonstrate that this unified framework significantly enhances the alignment between AI and human players across a diverse range of expertise levels, paving the way for deeper insights into human decision-making and AI-guided teaching tools.

We introduce SEAM, a benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21 contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="tay:2023:social-status-competitors-cause-decision-maker-errors" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Can higher social status of competitors cause decision makers to commit more errors?</div> <div class="author"> Li Qian Tay </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society</em>, Sep 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="tijhuis:2023:predicting-chess-rating-single-game" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Predicting Chess Player Rating Based on a Single Game</div> <div class="author"> Tim Tijhuis, Paris Mavromoustakos Blom, and Pieter Spronck </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In IEEE Conference on Games, CoG 2023, Boston, MA, USA, August 21-24, 2023</em>, Sep 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/COG57401.2023.10333133" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="urcan:2025:east-meets-east-inside-2024-world-chess-championship-singapore" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">East Meets East: Inside The 2024 World Chess Championship In Singapore</div> <div class="author"> Olimpiu G Urcan </div> <div class="periodical"> Sep 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/14303" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This book presents a compelling account of the historic FIDE world chess championship match between Ding Liren of China and Gukesh Dommaraju of India, held in Singapore from November 25 to December 13, 2024.

However, performing decompression on host systems can create performance bottlenecks. Accelerator libraries, such as nvCOMP, address this problem by providing custom GPU-enabled versions of some general-purpose compression methods, including Snappy, ZStandard and gzip. However, popular bzip-like compression schemes, which rely on block-sorting transforms have not yet been integrated since their fine-grained parallelization is challenging. With a focus on decompression, we propose novel techniques for fine-grained parallelization of inverse Burrows-Wheeler transform (iBWT) and inverse Move-to-Front (iMTF) transform on GPUs, which enable efficient processing of bzip2-based archives on CUDA-enabled accelerators for the first time. Consequently, we present the first fully GPU-enabled bzip2 decompression pipeline as a use case for the proposed algorithms. Our experimental results reveal speedups of up to 6.1x over a multicore CPU implementation for iBWT, and throughput rates of up to 2400 MB/s for combined iBWT and iMTF on an A100 GPU. For decompression of bzip2 archives, a throughput of over 11.62 GB/s is achieved on a DGX H100 server.

This renewed attention is driven by the recognition that current next-token prediction models often lack the ability for long-term planning. Is it possible to instill search-like abilities within the models to enhance their planning abilities without relying on explicit search? We propose DiffuSearch , a model that does \textitimplicit search by looking into the future world via discrete diffusion modeling. We instantiate DiffuSearch on a classical board game, Chess, where explicit search is known to be essential. Through extensive controlled experiments, we show DiffuSearch outperforms both the searchless and explicit search-enhanced policies. Specifically, DiffuSearch outperforms the one-step policy by 19.2% and the MCTS-enhanced policy by 14% on action accuracy. Furthermore, DiffuSearch demonstrates a notable 30% enhancement in puzzle-solving abilities compared to explicit search-based policies, along with a significant 540 Elo increase in game-playing strength assessment. These results indicate that implicit search via discrete diffusion is a viable alternative to explicit search over a one-step policy.

However, these systems are not human-aligned; they are unable to match the skill levels of all human partners or model human-like behaviors beyond piece movement. In this paper, we introduce Allie, a chess-playing AI designed to bridge the gap between artificial and human intelligence in this classic game. Allie is trained on log sequences of real chess games to model the behaviors of human chess players across the skill spectrum, including non-move behaviors such as pondering times and resignations In offline evaluations, we find that Allie exhibits humanlike behavior: it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art in human chess move prediction and ponders at critical positions. The model learns to reliably assign reward at each game state, which can be used at inference as a reward function in a novel time-adaptive Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) procedure, where the amount of search depends on how long humans would think in the same positions. Adaptive search enables remarkable skill calibration; in a large-scale online evaluation against players with ratings from 1000 to 2600 Elo, our adaptive search method leads to a skill gap of only 49 Elo on average, substantially outperforming search-free and standard MCTS baselines. Against grandmaster-level (2500 Elo) opponents, Allie with adaptive search exhibits the strength of a fellow grandmaster, all while learning exclusively from humans.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="zysko:2024:predicting-chess-puzzle-difficulty" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">IEEE Big Data Cup 2024 Report: Predicting Chess Puzzle Difficulty at KnowledgePit.ai</div> <div class="author"> Jan Zyśko, Maciej Świechowski, Sebastian Stawicki, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?
